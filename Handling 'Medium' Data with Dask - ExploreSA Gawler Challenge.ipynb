    "### In my previous notebooks we've looked at data cleaning, feature engineering and machine learning on geological datasets. All of these example datasets can be considered small in terms of 'big data', but for more informative data analysis (or ML models) it's necessary to increase the amount of data we use. However, we reach a problem when incorporating more and more data into our workflows; computing power. This notebook looks at how to deal with this issue, using the python package Dask to perform large data processes with a little laptop and providing a couple of helpful python hints along the way."

    "Firstly, let's define what big, medium and small data is in terms of size. A lot of what I've read online characterizes data as 'Big Data' when it contains high volume of data, a high variety in data types and slow velocity when it comes to processing (known as the 3 V's). A general rule of thumb I like is that small data is <10GB, medium data is <1TB and anything over 1TB is considered big data. As mentioned above, all previous notebook datasets have been within the 'small data' category and could be created/processed using python packages such as pandas, numpy and sklearn, but how do we do this for data that is too large for my RAM? \n",

    "With the [Unearthed ExploreSA Gawler](https://unearthed.solutions/u/exploresa-gawler) challenge coming up, I thought it'd a great opportunity to utilize spatial data from [SARIG](https://map.sarig.sa.gov.au/) for the example dataset. For this, I selected a large northern chunk of the Gawler Craton to focus on which incorporated 36 different map zones with a total area of 582,918.7 km^2. From SARIG, I downloaded a whole bunch of different geological data spanning from the Archaen basement lithology to surface regolith material. Using QGIS, I chose 22 features (listed below) that I wanted to put into a workable DataFrame. Keep in mind the selection of these features were chosen purely for this example and may or may not win you the Gawler Challenge."

First I clipped the data to my selected study area and then converted the files to raster, with each pixel representing a 50m x 50m area. Because the study area covers 582,918.7 km^2, each feature is composed of 242,832,800 pixels, we're definitely venturing into the realm of big data now. I saved each image as a ~1GB .tif file, ready to be loaded into python.\n",

    "With smaller datasets pandas can be used to create DataFrames, do feature engineering etc. but when we are dealing with 22 separate image files at 1GB each pandas just doesn't quite cut it. This is because pandas tries to combine all the files into one DataFrame and store it in my computers memory (or RAM). My computer has a RAM of 8GB and the file I'm trying to create is 22GB. This is where python package Dask comes into play. The way Dask operates is better explained [here](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/08/dask-big-datasets-machine_learning-python/), but it effectively splits large data files into multiple partitions and works on one partition at a time. Another great thing about Dask is that it is built on common python packages pandas, numpy and scikit learn, which means if you're already familiar with these packages it will be easy to understand Dask. Let's get started in setting up our DataFrame."

We have successfully added 240 columns to our DataFrame, making it even bigger than before, without having to buy a brand new super computer. From here we can go onto further feature engineering, data cleaning, other preprocessing and eventually machine learning if we wanted to. \n",
